# Event Sourcing
This is a basic event sourcing library for Rust. It provides elementary scaffolding to relieve you of the burden of reusing the same boilerplate for common event sourcing primitives, such as:

* Events
* Aggregates
* Commands
* Projectors
* Projections
* Event Store

Work is ongoing, initial crate is just a placeholder to hold the name until I return from an area without WiFi in a few days :D
